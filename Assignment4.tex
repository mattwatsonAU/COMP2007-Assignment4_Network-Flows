		\item \textbf{Argue why your algorithm is correct.}\\
		In this case, we have several limitations, these are:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item $k$: the number of forests, in this case, 2.
		\item $Y$: the number of years, in this case, 3.
		\item $\tau_i$: the maximum number of trees that can be harvested from forest $i$ over the entire Y years. In this case, we say $\tau_1=12$ and $\tau_2=8$, meaning that we are restricted over the entire period to harvested 12 trees from forest 1 and 8 trees from forest 2.
		\item $w_{k,Y}$: the maximum number of trees that can be harvested from forest $k$ in year $Y$. In this case we have $w_{1,1}=w_{1,2}=4, w_{1,3}=2$ and $w_{2,1}=w_{2,2}=w_{2,3}=3$.
		\item $\delta_j$: the lifetime of a tree harvested in year $j$, such that $\delta_1=3$ means a tree harvested in year 1 can only be sold in year 1,2 or 3. In this case, we have $\delta_1 =\delta_2 =2$ and $\delta_3 =1$
		\item $u_i$: The maximum number of trees that can be sold in year $i$. This does necessarily restrict the number of trees harvested, however, given for that year the $\delta_i$ value is greater than 1. In this case, we have $u_1=u_2=5$ and $u_2=10$.
